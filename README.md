# Crossy Roads 🐔🚗

A fun arcade-style crossing game made with Python and Pygame, inspired by the original Crossy Road. This version was built as a mini-project and is packaged into a standalone .exe so anyone can play without needing Python installed.

Created as a micro project by myself and @Giga4byte

- Use *arrow keys* to move the player (chicken).
- Avoid the cars and cross as many roads as you can!
- Stay alive and collect as many healthy foods as long as possible and try to beat your high score.
- Game over when you collect unhealthy food.
